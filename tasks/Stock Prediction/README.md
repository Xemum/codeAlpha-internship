# Stock Prediction using LSTM

This project focuses on predicting stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that are well-suited for sequence prediction tasks like stock price forecasting.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of historical stock price data of a chosen company. This data typically includes features such as date, opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price, and trading volume.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can forecast future stock prices based on historical data. By training an LSTM model on past stock prices, we aim to predict the future movement of the stock accurately.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The historical stock price data is preprocessed to remove any noise, handle missing values, and scale the data appropriately for training the LSTM model.

2. **Model Building**: An LSTM model architecture is designed and implemented using suitable parameters such as the number of LSTM units, dropout rates, and activation functions. The model is trained on the preprocessed data to learn the patterns in the historical stock prices.

3. **Model Evaluation**: The performance of the trained LSTM model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on a validation dataset or through cross-validation.

4. **Prediction**: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to make predictions on unseen or future stock price data. These predictions can provide insights into the potential future movement of the stock.

## Results

The results of the stock price predictions generated by the LSTM model are analyzed and compared against actual stock prices to assess the model's accuracy and effectiveness in forecasting.

## Conclusion

Stock price prediction using LSTM networks is a challenging yet promising task in the field of financial forecasting. While LSTM models have shown success in capturing temporal dependencies and patterns in sequential data, they also come with their own set of challenges such as overfitting and hyperparameter tuning.

Continued research and experimentation with different architectures and strategies for training LSTM models can lead to improved accuracy and robustness in stock price prediction. Additionally, incorporating external factors and data sources may further enhance the predictive capabilities of the model.

Overall, this project serves as a demonstration of utilizing deep learning techniques for predicting stock prices and highlights the potential applications of LSTM networks in financial forecasting tasks.
