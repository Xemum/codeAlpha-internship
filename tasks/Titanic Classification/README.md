# Titanic Classification

This project is aimed at creating a predictive system to determine whether a person would survive the sinking of the Titanic. The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous maritime disasters in history, and this project seeks to analyze various factors that may have influenced survival rates, such as socio-economic status, age, gender, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including whether they survived or not. The dataset includes features such as passenger class, age, sex, number of siblings/spouses aboard, number of parents/children aboard, ticket number, fare, cabin number, and port of embarkation.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to build a classification model that can accurately predict whether a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic based on the available features. By analyzing the data and training various machine learning models, we aim to identify which factors were most likely to lead to survival.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: This involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We will perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset and understand the relationships between different variables. This will help us identify which features are likely to be strong predictors of survival.

3. **Feature Engineering**: We may create new features or transform existing ones to improve the performance of our models.

4. **Model Selection and Training**: We will train various classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, etc., and evaluate their performance using suitable metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: We will fine-tune the hyperparameters of the selected models to optimize their performance.

6. **Model Evaluation**: Finally, we will evaluate the performance of our models using cross-validation and assess their generalization performance on unseen data.

## Results

The results of the classification models will be summarized, highlighting the most important factors contributing to survival on the Titanic.
